This project is for my Basics of Mechatronics class. The project is about a fan system. The fans speed changes depending on the temperature. When the temperature reaches a set risky degree, a red led will turn on and the buzzer will start buzzing. If the temperature levels are below the set risky degree, the green led will be lit and red light alongside with the buzzer will turn off. The temperature levels and the Fan Speed percentage will be shown on an LCD Screen. The code currently lacks the code for the fan speed. Code will be added when it's complete.
